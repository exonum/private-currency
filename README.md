**Documentation:** [![crate docs (master)](https://img.shields.io/badge/master-yellow.svg?label=docs)][crate-doc]

This is an [Exonum] service implementing a privacy-preserving cryptocurrency. The service hides the amounts being
transferred among registered accounts (but not the identities of transacting accounts).

Behind the scenes, the service uses [the Rust implementation][bulletproofs-rs] of [Bulletproofs], a particular
type of zero-knowledge proofs.

**Warning.** This is a proof of concept; it has not been tested and fitted for production. Use at your own risk.

## Description

See [implementation details](docs/implementation.md) and [service crate docs][crate-doc].

## Building and testing

Notice that the service requires `nightly` Rust channel as of now; the `bulletproofs` crate doesnâ€™t build otherwise.
There are some unit and integration tests and also examples. See their documentation for more details.
